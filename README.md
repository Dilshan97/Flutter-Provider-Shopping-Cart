# Flutter & Provider Shopping Cart App

A simple flutter application with includeing the state management techniques with the [Provider State Management](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)  package.

In this project, I'll try to learn how to integrate the Provider State Management Package into the Flutter application and improve the existing app UI. I'm not using any third party API's for fetch the products to the app.

*TODO:*

- Integrate the Firebase Firestore to manage products
- Authentication with Firebase
- Improve UI's
